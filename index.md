## Welcome, to my humble abode

Thanks for taking the time to find out a bit about me.

I develop software and often wonder whether my Myersâ€“Briggs Type\* actually means anything.

Please check out my <a href="https://junklibrary.wordpress.com" target="_blank">portfolio website</a> 
and <a href="https://github.com/iamhaker23/" target="_blank">Github</a>.

Recent projects include video games, university assignments, a budgeting program and various websites. 

Hopefully you'll find me to be pragmatic, prolific and productive. It comes from my experience across a corporate Telco. role (full-time), undergraduate study, casual jobs, side-projects and an internship.

\* I've had ENTP-T and INFJ-T. Perhaps I need to find a more reliable source?
